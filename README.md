# InstaMart Analysis and NLP Projects

## Overview
This repository showcases multiple data analysis and NLP projects, focusing on customer behavior analysis, named entity recognition in the cricket domain, and sentiment analysis on reviews. These projects highlight the application of Python, Pandas, the Apriori algorithm, and several Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using SpaCy and other libraries.

## Projects

## 1. InstaMart Analysis
- Objective: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover purchasing patterns and customer behavior within InstaMart datasets.
- Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Apriori Algorithm
- Key Highlights:
Conducted EDA using Pandas to gain insights into purchasing trends and customer preferences.
Applied the Apriori algorithm to perform Market Basket Analysis, identifying frequently purchased items together.
## 2. Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Cricket Domain
- Objective: Develop a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify and classify named entities specific to cricket-related text.
- Tech Stack: SpaCy v3, GPT, Prompting Techniques
- Key Highlights:
Gathered data using GPT-based prompting techniques.
Trained a custom NER model using SpaCy v3 to accurately recognize cricket players, teams, and match-related terms.
## 3. Sentiment Analysis on Reviews Dataset
- Objective: Analyze customer reviews to identify sentiment trends and classify feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Tech Stack: Python, NLP, VADER, TF-IDF, Stopwords Removal, Tokenization
- Key Highlights:
Preprocessed the dataset by removing stopwords and tokenizing text.
Applied VADER for sentiment analysis and used TF-IDF vectorization to evaluate the importance of terms in customer reviews.

## Learning Outcomes

Gained proficiency in performing EDA to identify trends in datasets.
Enhanced understanding of Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm.
Acquired hands-on experience with Named Entity Recognition (NER) models and cricket-specific text classification.
Developed expertise in analyzing sentiments using a combination of NLP techniques, including VADER and TF-IDF vectorization.
